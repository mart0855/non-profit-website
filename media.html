				<figcaption>Florida Halts Climate Change by Banning It
					<p>In a stunning act, the state of Florida has single-handedly eradicated climate change. This bold move to ban the words <em>climate change</em> and <em>global warming</em> from being uttered has led to sweeping changes&mdash;the complete breakdown of global ecosystems has achieved stability, species loss has all but stopped, ice formation has increased to their pre-industrial era levels. Humans are once again free to completely screw the planet over in ways unimaginable. Thank you, Florida. Thank you.</p>

				<figcaption>Report: Vanishing Pieces of the Puzzle
					<p>America's forests are home to an astonishing variety of life, from sweetly singing songbirds and roaming black bears to migrating salmon and unique pitcher plants.
